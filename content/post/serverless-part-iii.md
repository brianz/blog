This is part three in my series about creating serverless systems using AWS API Gateway + Lambda
via the [Serverless](http://serverless.com) project. If you're haven't already you can read 
[part I]({{< ref "serverless-part-i.md" >}}) and [part II]({{< ref "serverless-part-ii.md" >}}).

My goal is to continue evolving this example to walk through a non-trivial example of doing
something with the serverless architecture. Along the way I'll demo some useful features which
you'll undoubtedly run into when doing real development with Serverless.
