My name is Brian Zambrano and this is my tiny corner of the internet where I (mostly) talk about
software and related technology. I currently reside in Fort Collins, CO with my wife and twin boys.
In addition to software I really like the outdoors, coffee and cycling.

I recently wrote a book about [Serverless Design Patterns and Best
Practices](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/serverless-design-patterns-and-best-practices).
There are plenty of good tips and tricks in there for anyone building serverless applications, and
I'd encourage you to check it out.

My book covers several general patterns for serverless applications which may be applied to most
cloud providers. Each chapter has a real-world example of an application which explains a
particular pattern. All of the code for the example can be found in this Github repository:

## Background

You can read more about my professional background on my LinkedIn profile to the
left. In a nutshell, I grew up in Sunnyvale, CA and originally studied [Materials
Engineering](http://mate.calpoly.edu) at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. I ended up back home in the
middle of the first dot-com boom in 2000 and fell into software. Eventually I got a second degree
in computer science from [San Francisco State](http://cs.sfsu.edu).

## Areas of interest

I taught myself Python around 2001 and have been using continually since then and professionally
since 2005. In addition to Python my current areas of interest are:

- Serverless applications and architecture
- Amazon web services
- Microservice design and architecture
- Docker
- Elixir and its ecosystem (Phoenix, Erlang)
- Scaling development teams and platforms
- Blockchain development

Of course, I have **many** more interests but those are the highlights.

I'm currently employed at [Very](http://verypossible.com) building awesome things for our
clients.

## RoastLog

In 2008 I had an idea for a SAAS platform for coffee roasters. That idea grew and turned into
[RoastLog](http://roastlog.com/). I've been running RoastLog as a real business since 2009 with my
long-time friend and business partner, Linsey Fan. RoastLog is used every day of the week all over
the world to help coffee roasters run their business.
