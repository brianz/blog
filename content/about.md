My name is Brian Zambrano and this is my tiny corner of the internet where I (mostly) talk about
software and related technology. I currently reside in Fort Collins, CO with my wife and twin boys.
In addition to software I really like the outdoors, coffee and cycling.

## Background

You can read more about my professional background on my LinkedIn profile to the
left. In a nutshell, I grew up in Sunnyvale, CA and originally studied [Materials
Engineering](http://mate.calpoly.edu) at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. I ended up back home in the
middle of the first dot-com boom in 2000 and fell into software. Eventually I got a second degree
in computer science from [San Francisco State](http://cs.sfsu.edu).

## Areas of interest

I taught myself Python around 2001 and have been using continually since then and professionally
since 2005. In addition to Python my current areas of interest are:

- Docker
- Elixir and its ecosystem (Phoenix, Erlang)
- Microservice design and architecture
- Amazon web services
- Scaling development teams and platforms
- Postgresql

Of course, I have **many** more interests but those are the highlights.

I'm currently employed at [Spartan](http://joinspartan.com) building awesome things for our
clients.

## RoastLog

In 2008 I had an idea for a SAAS platform for coffee roasters. That idea grew and turned into
[RoastLog](http://roastlog.com/). I've been running RoastLog as a real business since 2009 with my
long-time friend and business partner, Linsey Fan. RoastLog is used every day of the week all over
the world to help coffee roasters run their business.
